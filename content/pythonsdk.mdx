# Python SDK

The ResilientDB Python SDK provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with ResilientDB using Python. This SDK allows you to perform various operations such as creating transactions, querying the blockchain, and managing smart contracts.

## Installation

```bash
pip install resilientdb-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```python
from resilientdb.client import Client

# Initialize the client
client = Client('http://localhost:8080')

# Create a transaction
transaction = client.create_transaction(
    sender='your_public_key',
    recipient='recipient_public_key',
    amount=100
)

# Send the transaction
response = client.send_transaction(transaction)
print(f"Transaction ID: {response['id']}")
```
